            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Fanaticks Dream.</head>
            <p>MY weary Carcaſe being ſorely oppreſſed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of <hi>Catchpoles,</hi> I laid me down to ſleep, ſetting my Fancy Sentinel, who walking the Rounds of my Mind, in an inſtant conveyed me into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Forreſt, tenanted with Beaſts of prey; the firſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf to my view was a <hi>Crocodile</hi> preying upon a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and having eat his Body, he diſtilled tears over his Head, as if he was grieved to be his Executioner, who had deſerved it by encroaching upon his Territories. But I ſaw this was but as ſour Sauce to whet his glutted Appetite, for after it with more eagerneſs than ever he devoured the reſt; then I thought that my ſelf muſt next be ſacrificed to his Luſt: But theſe Jealouſies were extinguiſhed by a hideous noiſe which I heard, then looking about me I ſaw a great number of ſavage <hi>Beaſts, viz.</hi> The <hi>Panther</hi> (which by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty tyranniz'd over others) going firſt, his Skin was of a lovely Colour, and curious to behold, but his Head was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and dyed in Blood; then followed twelve <hi>Lyons</hi> of <hi>Cleonia</hi> roaring, with an innumerable Company of <hi>Dragons, Tygers, Leoperds, Bears, Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Camelions,</hi> all likewiſe with their Mouths dyed in Blood; thus they marched, till at laſt they came to a pleaſant Iſland ſurrounded with a Cryſtal Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, into which my Fancy led me, and I beheld it abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Flocks of <hi>Sheep,</hi> and Parks of ſtately <hi>Deer,</hi> Nature having conſtituted a War-like <hi>Hart</hi> for the Defender, whoſe endeavours were continually to preſerve the <hi>Sheep</hi> from the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Forreſt. But methoughts the <hi>Panther</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by allurements to entice the <hi>Hart</hi> to behold his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Skin, thereby to make him his Prey. But the <hi>Hart</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his intrigue, which the <hi>Panther</hi> perceiving, with all his Retinue enter'd the River, furiouſly aſſaulting the <hi>Hart,</hi> but the <hi>Hart</hi> behaving himſelf courageouſly cauſed them with ſhame to flee to the Forreſt for ſhelter. Nevertheleſs preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſaw a <hi>Dragon</hi> haſting to the Iſland to deſtroy the <hi>Sheep,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52650:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>but was happily prevented by a <hi>Fawn,</hi> then the <hi>Dragon</hi> with anguiſh gnaſhing, caſt forth fire and fired the Sheepfold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the <hi>Sheep</hi> ſcarce eſcap'd with the Wool on their backs, and then he haſted to the Forreſt for his eſcape. But not long after came over a <hi>Beare,</hi> and ſome <hi>Wolves,</hi> who kill'd one of the beſt <hi>Sheep</hi> in the Flock, and grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly tore many others, which with patience they endured; but their ſilence was a motive to the <hi>Fawn;</hi> for he valiantly encountred and ſlew them, by which he incurred the great diſpleaſure of a <hi>Stag;</hi> which having ranged the Forreſt, had no ſmall kindneſs for the <hi>Panther;</hi> therefore the <hi>Stag</hi> chaſed him out of the Iſland, and cauſed him to croſs the River; but not being ſafe there, he returned and lived ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely amongſt the Flock. A little <hi>Evet</hi> alſo did endeavour to enfatuate the Brook where the <hi>Hart</hi> uſed to drink, but two <hi>Rams</hi> laid hold of him, and had ſtain him, had not a <hi>Deer</hi> coming in to help them, made them let go their hold; in proceſs of time, methought the <hi>Hart</hi> dyed, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came in the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Forreſt, with whom the wild <hi>Deers</hi> joyned, and devoured the <hi>Sheep:</hi> But the <hi>Fawn,</hi> with ſome of the choiceſt in the Flock fled, and were miraculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly preſerved. But the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Forreſt not willing to loſe ſuch a prey as were the <hi>Deers,</hi> ſlew them alſo; and they being thus exalted with their fat paſture, had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al jarrings among themſelves, till at length, they beginning to devour each other, then methought the <hi>Fawn</hi> with his Sheep returned again into their baniſhed Iſland, valiantly, and triumphantly extirpating them, and flouriſhed more than ever. So I Awoke.</p>
